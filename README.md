Protein language models, leveraging NLP techniques, have shown significant promise in identifying binding sites and contact sites within protein sequences. By embedding protein sequences into continuous vector spaces and employing transformer architectures, these models can capture intricate patterns and dependencies that indicate functionally important regions. Specifically, models like ProtBERT and ESM can be fine-tuned to predict interaction sites by learning from large-scale sequence data and known binding site annotations. This capability not only aids in understanding protein functionality but also accelerates drug design by pinpointing potential targets for therapeutic interventions.
